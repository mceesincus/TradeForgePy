# TradeForgePy

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**A generic, asynchronous, and production-ready Python library for interacting with trading platform APIs.**

TradeForgePy provides a clean, modern, and provider-agnostic interface for both REST API calls and real-time data streaming. It is built with a focus on reliability, data integrity, and developer ergonomics, making it an ideal foundation for building trading bots, custom dashboards, and analytical tools.

## Key Features

*   **Provider-Agnostic by Design:** A clear separation between the generic core and provider-specific implementations. Start with TopStepX, and easily extend to more providers in the future.
*   **Fully Asynchronous:** Built from the ground up with `asyncio` and `httpx` for high-performance, non-blocking I/O operations.
*   **Resilient Real-Time Streams:** The streaming client automatically handles dropped connections with exponential backoff and includes a circuit breaker for permanent authentication errors, ensuring your application remains stable.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** A clear exception hierarchy and a "supervisor" pattern for stream data handlers means that internal errors are caught, logged, and won't silently crash your application.
*   **Modern Pydantic Models:** All API responses and real-time events are parsed into clean, type-hinted Pydantic models for easy and safe data manipulation.
*   **Efficient and Safe:** Features like in-memory caching for semi-static data and explicit handling of API limitations are built-in to ensure performance and prevent data corruption.

## Installation

```bash
pip install tradeforgepy

Configuration

To use the library, you must provide your API credentials. TradeForgePy automatically loads these from a .env file located in your project's root directory.

Create a file named .env in the root of your project.

Add your provider-specific credentials. For TopStepX, these are:

# .env file

# Required: Your TopStepX username and API Key
TS_USERNAME="your_username_here"
TS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Optional: The trading environment ('LIVE' or 'DEMO'). Defaults to 'DEMO'.
TS_ENVIRONMENT="DEMO"

Quick Start: Fetching Account Data

This example shows the simplest way to connect to your provider and fetch account information.

import asyncio
import logging

from tradeforgepy import TradeForgePy
from tradeforgepy.exceptions import TradeForgeError

# Set up basic logging to see what's happening
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

async def main():
    """
    Connects to the provider, fetches account data, and disconnects.
    """
    # 1. Initialize the provider factory
    # This automatically finds and loads credentials from your .env file
    provider = TradeForgePy.create_provider("TopStepX")

    try:
        # 2. Connect to the provider's API
        print("Connecting to provider...")
        await provider.connect()
        print("Connection successful!")

        # 3. Fetch your accounts
        accounts = await provider.get_accounts()
        if not accounts:
            print("No accounts found.")
        else:
            print(f"Found {len(accounts)} account(s):")
            for acc in accounts:
                print(f"  - Account ID: {acc.provider_account_id}, Name: {acc.account_name}, Balance: {acc.balance}")

    except TradeForgeError as e:
        logging.error(f"An API error occurred: {e}", exc_info=True)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}", exc_info=True)
    finally:
        # 4. Always ensure a clean disconnection
        if provider:
            print("Disconnecting...")
            await provider.disconnect()
            print("Disconnected.")

Real-Time Streaming Example

This example demonstrates how to subscribe to a real-time market data stream.

import asyncio
import logging

from tradeforgepy import TradeForgePy
from tradeforgepy.core.enums import MarketDataType, StreamConnectionStatus
from tradeforgepy.config import settings

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

async def main():
    """
    Connects to the real-time stream and subscribes to market data.
    """
    provider = TradeForgePy.create_provider("TopStepX")
    
    # 1. Define your event handlers
    async def on_event(event):
        # This is where you would put your trading logic!
        print(f"EVENT: {event.model_dump_json(indent=2)}")

    async def on_status_change(status: StreamConnectionStatus, reason: str):
        print(f"STATUS CHANGE: {status.value} - Reason: {reason}")

    async def on_error(error: Exception):
        logging.error(f"STREAM ERROR: {error}", exc_info=True)

    # 2. Register your handlers
    provider.on_event(on_event)
    provider.on_status_change(on_status_change)
    provider.on_error(on_error)

    try:
        # 3. Connect and start the stream runner in the background
        await provider.connect()
        runner_task = asyncio.create_task(provider.run_forever())
        
        # Wait for the connection to be established
        await asyncio.sleep(5) 

        # 4. Subscribe to the data you need
        contract_id = settings.TS_CAPTURE_CONTRACT_ID  # e.g., "CON.F.US.NQ.M25"
        print(f"Subscribing to QUOTE data for {contract_id}...")
        await provider.subscribe_market_data(
            provider_contract_ids=[contract_id],
            data_types=[MarketDataType.QUOTE]
        )

        # 5. Let the stream run (e.g., for 30 seconds)
        print("Streaming data for 30 seconds... Press Ctrl+C to exit early.")
        await asyncio.sleep(30)

    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("Run cancelled.")
    finally:
        print("Disconnecting provider...")
        await provider.disconnect()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        asyncio.run(main())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Process interrupted by user.")

This `README.md` file is now ready to be added to the project's root directory.

### Next Steps

This completes Part 1 of the "Incomplete Documentation & High-Level Abstractions" task.

**Part 2: Implement a High-Level Abstraction**

*   **Problem:** Users must manually manage provider-specific IDs (e.g., `"CON.F.US.NQ.M25"`) and cannot easily look up contracts by their common symbol (e.g., `'MESM5'`).
*   **Goal:** Add a user-friendly helper method to the provider that simplifies this common workflow. We will add a `get_contract_by_symbol` method. This will involve searching for the symbol and, if an exact match is found, returning its full details.

I am ready to proceed with this final task. Please confirm.
